# Real-Time Fatigue Detection with CNNs

This repository showcases a robust deep learning model designed for real-time fatigue detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system relies on a connected camera positioned at the face level to provide timely and accurate results.

## Key Features:

- **Advanced Deep Learning Model:** Our model is built on state-of-the-art CNN architecture to ensure high accuracy in detecting fatigue.
- **Large and Diverse Dataset:** The model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising hundreds of facial images meticulously labeled into two categories: normal and drowsy faces.
- **Real-Time Capability:** The system is optimized for real-time processing, making it suitable for applications where timely fatigue detection is crucial.

## Project Documentation:

In addition to the technical files, this repository includes a comprehensive scientific and technical report. This report encapsulates over six months of dedicated work, outlining the primary scientific methods and technical procedures employed throughout the project. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the intricacies of the model development and the rationale behind the chosen approaches.

**Note:** For optimal performance, ensure the camera is positioned at the face level during deployment.
